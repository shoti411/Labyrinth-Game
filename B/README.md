README.md: Readme filled with information about the project
xcollects: Bash script that runs the xcollects.py program
Other/xcollects.py: Python script that reads STDIN and prints acceptable characters into STDOUT. 
                    If it receives an unacceptable character it will print "unacceptable input".
                    On use of CTRL-D or at End of a File it will end the program and print to STDOUT.
                    On Window systems it will be CTRL-Z+Return. 

RoadMap:
Auxilary files are in B/Other. There is only 1 auxilary file contained in other which is xcollects.py which is the python script stated above.
In B directory contains only the README.md about the project and the xcollects bash script for user to call.

Testing:
Para Piazza post @16 there are no testing requirements other than manual testing.
