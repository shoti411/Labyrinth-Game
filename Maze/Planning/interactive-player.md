**SUBJECT: Graphical User Interfaces Ideas**</br>

Our plans for a graphical user interface shall encompass the following elements: joining a game, recommending a board, receiving a setup, taking a turn, and an end game screen.

The application will start as a menu with selections for strategy, player avatar, recommended board size, and other potential information we need about the player, as well as a button to join a game. After making their choices and clicking join they are left with a blank loading screen while waiting for setup information.<\br>

When a player receives there setup information they will be brought to the game screen. This will encompass a board with players homes and players avatars depicted, the extra tile, drop down strategy menu, a readable text box, and exit game button. The drop down strategy menu is the only interactive element of the game screen. It will allow a player to change there strategy mid game. The readable textbox includes information about the game state such as whose turn it is, the players home position, their current position, their goal position, the strategy they have currently chosen, and their avatar.</br>

After each turn is made by a players strategy the next player will receive an updated game screen. Once a game has finished, a popup will display a message about the outcome and a disconnect button.</br>
